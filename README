My personal template for project based on Django web framework with a sensible
set of default settings, pip requirements and other nice to haves.

Create your new project env with a single command.

The startproject script is able to setup a new Django-based project for you.
Say you want to start works on a not-yet-existing project called djangoproject.
Run these:

  $ cd /path/to/project/parent/directory
  $ ../path/to/django-new-project-template/startproject djangoproject

The script will

  * copy the Django project template,
  * rename dirs and identifiers to djangoproject,
  * generate and set the SECRET_KEY and database password,

then the script will ask and optionally

  * init the new git repositury & create the first commit,
  * setup the virtualenv,
  * install the required packages except Django.

You will also get hints about how to continue.
